The folder 2012Fall is the original cheat sheet and study sheet created by willieneis. All my cheat sheet are created based on his version. 

This is for Course CMU 10-705/36-705 Intermediate Statistics in 2014 Fall.

The final cheat sheet contains 4 pages. However, you could print 2 pages per side. I tried, it works just perfect.
